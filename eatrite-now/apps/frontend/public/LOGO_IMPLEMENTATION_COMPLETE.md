### 🎯 **To Use Your Original Logo Image:**

If you want to use your exact logo image instead of the SVG version:

1. **Save your logo as**: `/Users/Sairamperumalla/eatritecom.com-1/eatrite-now/apps/frontend/public/eatrite-logo.png`

2. **Update the logo component** to use the image:
```tsx
<img 
  src="/eatrite-logo.png" 
  alt="EatRite Logo" 
  className="w-10 h-10 drop-shadow-lg"
/>
```

### 🌟 **Current Status:**
Your EatRite application now displays a beautiful, professional logo that perfectly represents your brand's focus on healthy, natural eating. The golden fork and leaves design communicates freshness, quality, and culinary excellence!
